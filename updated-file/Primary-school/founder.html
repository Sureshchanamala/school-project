        young minds

        Treasurer for over 15 years in bringing all school together has made the Regional
        Association a strong body looking into the matters concerning the CISCE Curriculum
        and syllabus and implementing the same. Through the Regional Association
        the students get a wonderful opportunity to prove their talent and skills in sports and

      <p>Life can bring opportunities, the world can propel your progress,
        but the only way to get further, to go all the way, is through hard work,
        dedication and sincerity. If you love what you do, there are hundreds of opportunities,
        if you surround yourself with good, right – minded people and good books and if you are in touch with avenues
        where you are corrected,
        educated to live a right life, there is no dearth of chances. The perfection in us manifests through education
        and speaks through our noble deeds.
        When we assume the responsibility of strengthening the nation through education,
        we tread on a path where every step demands our best attention.</p>

      <p>In the ever changing scenario of the world,
        it is the moral responsibility of every educational institution to groom the child according to the growing
        needs of the new age.
        Our effort is to energize our students to the core principles of success like confidence, courage and conduct,
        keeping in touch with our culture, traditions and values.
        Our aim is to see that our students grow to be global citizens, proud Indians and finally good human beings.</p>

      <p>It was a humble beginning in the year 1980 with a mere 18 staff members and 350 students.
        The school has grown impressively for over 35 years, with the staff crossing 250 and the strength of the
        students about 5500.
        A strong foundation of values and contemporary outlook encourages the students to emerge as multifaceted
        individuals ready to take on the world.</p>

      <p>While addressing the needs of every student and channelizing the intellect of every learner,
        a congenial, happy and positive environment is honed where each child feels secure,
        loved and respected. Looking beyond the present, stability and certainty is what we care for.</p>
      <p>
        While wishing for the years full of activity and achievements,
        there are prayers for peace, balance and harmony around the world in an atmosphere of healthy give and take
      </p>

      <p class="bst-wishes"> Best Wishes to all.</p>

        suggestions from different spheres a governing body is constituted comprising members from the Management,
        teaching staff and parents. During the course of regular meeting of this body a review of the important matters
        pertaining to the improvement of the infrastructure and other facilities is done.
        The parent body is well informed about the future course of action and their valuable feedback and opinion is
